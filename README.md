Motive: Learning session and cookie-based authentication, and authorization with .NET Core.

Features:
* User Registration
* Login with session cookies
* Logout functionality
* Session-based authorization with idle timeout

Tech Stack:
* .NET Core (Web API and MVC)
* Entity Framework Core for database operations & Database used Sql Server
* Session and cookies for authentication

Note: If you want to see magic! log in and wait for 2+ minutes. You will be logged out automatically. This magic happens when the session expires. 
Thank you.
